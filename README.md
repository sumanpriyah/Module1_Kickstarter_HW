# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project analysis is done on campaigns outcomes based on their Launch Date and Goals on data provided by using Filtering, conditional formatting Pivot tables , VLOOKUP, Charts and graphs.
### Purpose 
The purpose of this project is to help Louise to get successful campaign based on the outcomes by Launched dates and goals using Kickstarter data for similar Category and Subcategory.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
Overall more number of campaigns are launched in Summer time frame- May , June and July.
**Successful Kickstarter campaigns-** Based on the data provided for "theater", successful Kickstarter campaigns are high in May and June. In feb, April and August the results are similar. From graph The results moved up in Feb, May and October.
**Failed Kickstarter campaigns-** Results  are high in May, June, July and October. Results are similar in Jan, March, Sept ,Nov.
**Canceled-** Mostly number of canceled compaigns are in Jan.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
Percentage successful is high initially when goal was less than 1000. As goal started increasing percentage failed started going up. Percentage successful and failed are similar when goal is from 15000 to 20000. There is sharp fall of percentage successful when goal is 25000 to 30000. Data shows when goal is getting higher then total number of projects are low. So even one or two projects (passed/failed) will make huge difference on percentage. When the goal is too high can be consider as outlier.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Just looking at outcomes based on Goals and Launched date its hard to give complete picture, there could be another factors playing role for failed kickstarter campaigns like deadlies, pledged and backers count, country/region. 
Successful Kickstarter campaigns and failed Kickstarter campaigns both are in higher range during May, June and July which means there is another factor playing role in Failed Kickstarter campaigns.
Both campaigns as per the graph went up in Feb, May and October and went down in March and Sept so there is another factor which is contributing to the change. 

## Results
- **What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**

 **1)** Over all number of campaigns are launched during May, June and July which means if Louise launched her campaign during that time specially in May when most number of successful campaigns are launched the chances of         success seems more as per the data. 

**2)** If Louise launch her campaign in US or GB where there are more number of launch then other countries

- **What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**

**1)** When goals are less than percentage success is more which means if Louise keeps the goals below 10,000 then chances of Success Kickstarter is greater. 

**2)** Other factor which contributes to Successful Kickstarter is the number of backers. If number of backers are more then chances of successful campaign are higher. 

- **What are some limitations of this dataset?**

**1)** Age group for backers was not provided 

**2)** House hold Income of the backers was not provided

**3)** Other factor which was contributing to higher pass/fail is not clear as the data based on Goals where goals are outlier(very high).

- **What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**

**1)** Table and graph based on Date Ended Conversion column

**2)** Box and Whisker - Goal and Pledged
